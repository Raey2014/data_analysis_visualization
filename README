This project is merely for practice on data analysis and visualization using the NYPD data. In this analysis, I tried to study patterns of crime using time and geographical coordinates. Based on this pattern, we can predict the likely place and time where crime can occur and NYPD can take necessary measures. The notebook uses Pandas and seaborn.
